  synopsis: |
    An example log entry looks like this:

    > &lt;syslog.info&gt;1  2015-07-27 23:32:23.412307 hostname rsyslogd - - -  [origin software="rsyslogd" swVersion="8.4.2" x-pid="1063" x-info="http://www.rsyslog.com"] rsyslogd was HUPed

    The log format is based on [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) with some modifications to make it easier humans-readable.

    This role also changes some logrotate defaults. Those changes are made to better work with logcheck.
