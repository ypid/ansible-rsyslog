  synopsis: |
    An example logline locks like this:

        <syslog.info>1  2015-07-27 23:32:23.412307 hostname rsyslogd - - -  [origin software="rsyslogd" swVersion="8.4.2" x-pid="1063" x-info="http://www.rsyslog.com"] rsyslogd was HUPed

    The log format is based on [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) with some modifications to make it easier readable for humans.

    This role also changes some logrotate defaults.
